Abstract Factory is a creational design pattern that lets you produce families of related objects 
without specifying their concrete classes.

usecase : when you wanna create superclass that have the same subclasses but with different type

example : create sports factory with different brand

Step : 
1. Create interface for the Factories
2. Create each factory based on the interface
3. Create interface for the Products
4. Create each of the abstract product based on the interface
5. Set the product factory to the abstract product
