Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes 
into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

split two or more object, find the middle ground. from that middle ground you can create multiple object.

shape and color class = you can create different kind of shape with different kind of color.
