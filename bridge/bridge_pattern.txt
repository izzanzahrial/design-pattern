Bridge is a structural design pattern that lets you split a large class or a set of closely related classes 
into two separate hierarchies—abstraction and implementation—which can be developed independently of each other.

usecase : when you want to have 2 large class with their own dependency so they can developed independently.

example : API for GUI for different type of platform.

step :
1. Create 2 interface from the large class
2. One of them implement the other interface inside it's own method.
