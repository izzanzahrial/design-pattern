Composite is a structural design pattern that lets you compose objects into tree structures 
and then work with these structures as if they were individual objects.

usecase : when you want to do something to the subclass without knowing or opening the subclass itself.

example : count paycheck from all employee.

step :
1. Create common interface for the superclass and the subclass(leaf node)
2. the interface method have to work recursively, so when you call from the top it will go down
