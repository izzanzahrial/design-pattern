Adapter is a structural design pattern that allows objects with incompatible interfaces to collaborate.

usecase : when you wanna use the legacy code in something brand new or 
        when you wanna change the data inside the objects or 
        when you want to 2 different objects to collaborate with each other. (3rd party app or legacy)

example : transform json into xml or yaml.
        adapter in pc.
    
Step :
1. Create the first object and it's interface.
2. The new object have to implement the interface.
3. If not incompatible create the adapter for the new object.
4. Create the adapter to turn the 3rd party app or legacy into the useable stuff that you need.
