Prototype is a creational design pattern that lets you copy existing objects 
without making your code dependent on their classes.

usecase : when you wanna copy object without the dependencies

example : create a copy for folder and file structure

step :
1. Create the interface that implement clone method
2. Create the algorithm for the clone method which it will create the copy of the object,
you can add something to it to make it little different from the original object.
