put each of them into a separate class, and make their objects interchangeable.

Create a superclass that can use one of strategy
you can create multiple strategy, and it is interchangeable.

in state you change the object(state) by using the method.
in strategy you chose the object(strategy) by selecting which strategy do you wanna use.
