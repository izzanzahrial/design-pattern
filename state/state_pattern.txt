State is a behavioral design pattern that lets an object alter its behavior when its internal state changes. 
It appears as if the object changed its class.

the main class only have to implement the current state, 
and the actual state will carry the load by doing the actual hardwork.

the different between state and observer
observer waiting the signal from the outside class
state get the signal from within itself
