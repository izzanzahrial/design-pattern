Builder is a creational design pattern that lets you construct complex objects step by step.
The pattern allows you to produce different types and
representations of an object using the same construction code.

Step :
1. Create interface for Builder
2. Create method for each type of Builder
3. Create a director that you can use to set the type of builder you wanna use,
    you can change the type of builder by using the director and from the director also you build the product.
