Factory Method is a creational design pattern that provides an interface for creating objects in a superclass,
but allows subclasses to alter the type of objects that will be created.

Step : 
1. Create interface for the Products
2. Create each of the abstract product based on the interface
3. Set the product factory to the abstract product
